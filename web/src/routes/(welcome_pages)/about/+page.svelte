	<p>I'm building a social media app that fills in the gap that old FB used to, with posts by friends, family, and connections.
	   It's focusing on two parts that I find particularly interesting -- broadcasting events to friends, and following along with what your friends are reading / watching / playing / etc.  And sharing what you love too.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<H2>Recommendations</H2>

	<p>One part personal organization tracking what you're interested in, want to watch next, or share what you already love.
	  It's also one part social media, seeing what your friends are watching or recommend.
	  I believe that recommendations are more meaningful coming from the people you know, than what "the algorithm" recommends.  Choosing what to watch or read next is more interesting, when you know you'll have people to talk about it with.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<H2>Events</H2>

	<p>I want to broadcast to friends concerts and other events that I'm interested in, so I can see who wants to join.  I want to see what my friends are interested in and are seeking company for.
	Our relationships grow when we spend time together</p>
